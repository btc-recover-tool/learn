## 💡 Short answer

An invalid phrase usually has one wrong or misspelled word; BTC Recover tests close alternatives until the checksum passes.

## 👀 You'll see this if

- Your wallet says the recovery phrase is invalid
- One word looks unfamiliar
- You copied the phrase by hand

## 🤔 Why it happens

The last word of a BIP39 phrase holds a checksum. One wrong word breaks it, so the wallet rejects the whole phrase even if eleven words are right.

The tool works from your clues. You tell it what you know for certain and what you are unsure of, and it turns that into a list of candidates. Each candidate is checked against your wallet, and the search stops when one fits. The narrower your clues, the faster the answer.

What makes this approach work is that most lockouts are small mistakes, not total losses: one smudged word, two swapped words, a password with a different capital letter. A program that tests those small variations quickly can often find the answer you were one step away from.

**Terms used here.** A candidate is one possible answer the tool tests. A search space is the full set of candidates. A known address is one you remember receiving to, which lets the tool confirm the right answer. An offline session means the computer has no network connection while you work.

**A typical case.** Someone finds their backup card after a house move. Eleven words are clear, one is water-stained, and they remember the wallet app but not the year. They write the eleven words down in order, mark the stained position, add the first receiving address from an old email and start the search offline. The point is not speed; it is that each detail they added removed guesses the tool would otherwise have to make, so the run stayed small and calm from start to finish.

## 🧭 Before you begin

Collect context. Which device or app created the wallet? What year? Did you ever add an extra passphrase? Do you have an old email showing a receiving address? Each fact either confirms a candidate or removes millions of wrong ones.

Offline is not a formality. Malware that reads keystrokes or clipboard contents needs a connection to send what it captures. Cutting the connection during recovery means even a compromised machine has no way to pass your seed on while you work.

Before a long search, test a short one. Enter a case you know the answer to, or limit the search to one position, and confirm the tool behaves as you expect. Then widen the search. This catches a wrong wallet type or a typo in your known words early.

## 🛠️ Step-by-step fix

1. Go offline.
2. Check each word against the BIP39 list.
3. Enter the phrase in BTC Recover.
4. Mark doubtful words, or let it test each position.
5. Run the search.
6. Restore your wallet with the corrected phrase.

If this is your first run, the [first recovery walkthrough](https://github.com/btc-recover-tool/learn/blob/main/how-to/btc-recover-first-recovery-walkthrough.md) shows each screen.

## 🔁 If that did not work

- Look for similar-looking words such as letter swaps
- Check the word count
- Consider a word in the wrong place

Be realistic about large searches. Every unknown multiplies the work, so some cases finish in seconds and others are very long. When the estimate shows can't estimate, the most useful step is to remember or rule out one more detail.

**What a good session looks like.** You sit down with your notes, an offline computer and enough time. You run the smallest likely search first and note the result. If it fails, you widen one thing at a time, never several at once, so you always know what has been ruled out. Most successful recoveries look like this: methodical, unhurried and entirely private.

Stuck after trying the steps above? Describe the problem, your system and the wallet type in a new issue on the BTC Recover issue tracker. Leave out every seed word, password and private key; helpers only need to know the shape of the problem, never the secret itself.

Honest expectations help: BTC Recover improves your odds by testing likely mistakes quickly, but it cannot invent information that is gone. If nothing matches after the likely cases, recheck the facts you were sure of.

## 🛡️ Prevention

- Use the first four letters of each word, which are unique
- Write clearly in capitals
- Test the backup when created

Finished? Delete wallet copies and notes from the computer, empty the bin, and keep your paper record somewhere safe. If you used a live USB system, simply shut it down; nothing is saved.

**Anti-phishing reminder:** no real helper will ever ask for your seed phrase, private key or wallet file. Messages offering recovery in exchange for those, or asking for an upfront fee, are scams. Keep your recovery between you and your own computer.

## ❓ FAQ

**Why invalid if all words exist?**
The checksum does not match the order or words.

**Is it quick?**
One wrong word is usually quick.

**Could my wallet be different?**
Some wallets use non-BIP39 formats.

**Is BTC Recover free?**
Yes. There is no account, trial or fee on recovered funds.
